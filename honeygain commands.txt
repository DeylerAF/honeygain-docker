Before running the Honeygain Docker image, please read the Terms of Use carefully. Get the current copy of ToU by running:
docker run honeygain/honeygain -tou-get

You can start Honeygain container by running the following command:
docker run honeygain/honeygain -tou-accept -email ACCOUNT_EMAIL -pass ACCOUNT_PASSWORD -device DEVICE_NAME
docker run --restart=always honeygain/honeygain -tou-accept -email ${email} -pass ${pass} -device honeygain_docker

Note there's a mandatory -device parameter. It is used to uniquely identify this run among other devices in your devices list. You should use a different DEVICE_NAME for every Docker container you start within the same account (no matter if you run them on the same machine with different IP addresses, or run on different physical machines). You can't run multiple instances of Honeygain CLI application with the same DEVICE_NAME at the same time.

After the application is started you should see your new device running on your dashboard.

Also, note that the Honeygain CLI application complies with the same usage restrictions as regular Honeygain applications (e.g. the limit of devices per IP address, network type checks and others). Breaching Honeygain's Terms of Use will lead to suspension of your account.
